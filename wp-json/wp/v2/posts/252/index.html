You&#8217;ve skipped a crucial step and you&#8217;re going to pay for it forever. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me get this straight: it&#8217;s ok to make your own website and it&#8217;s normal to be frustrated. It&#8217;s ok to hire a freelancer within your budget. It&#8217;s ok to use a theme.  It&#8217;s ok to take your time and struggle a little &#8211; that&#8217;s how people learn things. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what isn&#8217;t really OK is the endless tweaking, of style and copy. No one else cares or notices, but it&#8217;s not OK with you. You&#8217;re going mad because you haven&#8217;t got the clarity of direction you need. There&#8217;s a step you have missed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;re obsessing over making it look better than you can afford, making it so no one will be bale to tell you&#8217;re whipping it up on squarespace. And it was going OK until &lt;insert one of a thousand things that can go wrong here>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;re struggling to communicate what you want with a designer&#8230; they&#8217;re just not getting it. Why aren&#8217;t they psychic? Why can&#8217;t you explain? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can tell it&#8217;s a bit of a DIY job (I used to be a webs designer but I&#8217;ve been out of the game for a while). But I think you&#8217;ll overlook this because I have a brand that speaks to you in some way (that I can&#8217;t totally predict).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been focussing on brand rather than technical things, because I know that getting brand right first will save me time making choices later. If I get someone to help me, it&#8217;ll be easy to explain what is needed and why, which will empower them to do their best work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you will forgive a shit website, but you&#8217;ll ignore a shit brand. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi homies.
