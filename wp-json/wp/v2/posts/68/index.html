What are they used to?<\/p>\n<p>If you try to design for everyone, you can&#8217;t make important decisions about what to include and how to present it.<\/p>\n<h2>Simple is scary<\/h2>\n<p>Simple is scary because if you don&#8217;t have a well defined brand, and don&#8217;t know this person well enough, you have no idea what should stay or go.<\/p>\n<p>You won&#8217;t want to cut anything away because &#8220;it could be useful.&#8221; You&#8217;re thinking, erroneously, that your thing is for EVERYONE. It&#8217;s not. Even if it is, if you market a thing to everyone no one will look. Even solar panels, things everyone needs and wants, are marketed to a demographic.<\/p>\n<p>So get your brand together, cut the fluff and make some impact.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why do designers always have make everything more complicated than it needs to be?
