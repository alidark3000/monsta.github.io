But a little brand strategy is essential for the success of any and every business. That the best hustles you know have a designed brand, whether it&#8217;s a personal or not. You know about them because of the brand &#8211; what you think about them is influenced by a brand that was designed to influence you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on a deeper level, you like them (or not) partly because of how it makes you feel about yourself, alters your belief structures in a way that vibes with your subsconscious mind. It does this by design, and it does this without you really knowing about it. Because this is good branding. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money is a major issue with side hustles.

They setup a brand and let that dictate choices. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is why brand strategy is useful &#8211; even a little. Have you seen the movie Limitless, where the guy suddenly knows what to do?
