I always thought the process was broken and I didn&#8217;t know why. I quit. Then I discovered The Futur and their Core Discovery framework, which helped me realise that design without strategy (how it ALWAYS happened with small business \/ micropeneur clients) is completely fucked and a waste of money and time. Business people need brand strategists before designers, or designers who can do a bit of brand strategy themselves. BUT WHO WANTS TO PAY FOR THAT SHIT? Not a lot of small businesses, it turns out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, MoNstA was born to offer these crucial services in ways everyone can afford.   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stuff<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand is where it all starts, but we can also extrapolate that into basic business and design assets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>a simple, website&#8230; maybe slightly more complex than this one but definitely Web 1.0 ish.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>messaging \/ copywriting<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>style + graphic asset kits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>More on our <a href=\"http:\/\/monsta.local\/services\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"139\">Services<\/a> page. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ali is a crazy monster with 43 years of experience ripping shit up.
