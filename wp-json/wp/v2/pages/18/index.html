There is no normal here. Please ask your friends on Linked In if you want normal. I personally find normal highly annoying (not to mention inhibiting).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b91d9045-4d7f-4036-9900-b3dade73f5d2\">I promise three things: <strong>Truth<\/strong>, monster metaphors when I can think of them, and <strong>brand.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"block-b5ee5a1b-0482-4a5b-8ec5-2003dfdbac81\">My story<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-06a5af3a-99ca-440e-a52d-adfb1340be9c\">(as far as it pertains to MoNstA. Hit me up to swap memoirs any time though).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-adf21613-a4e7-4a0c-9724-1b030d51ac9c\">I learned brandstrat the hard way. It started with half a decade of web and graphic design. I always thought the process was broken and I didn&#8217;t know why. I quit. Then one fortuitous day I discovered The Futur and their Core Discovery framework, which helped me realise that design the way it should be is entirely possible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-adf21613-a4e7-4a0c-9724-1b030d51ac9c\">Conversely I doubled down on my realisation that deisgn without strategy is completely fucked and a waste of money and time. You need strategy first, or at least designers who can do a bit of it. BUT WHO WANTS TO PAY FOR THAT? If you charge for what it&#8217;s worth, it&#8217;s just too much for a new business on a budget, let alone a single person chasing a pipe dream and explaining their purchases to a very significant other.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-0383117d-1cb3-4b01-bf13-05911283cbb8\">Hence, MoNstA was born to offer these crucial services in ways you &#8211; someone working their way out of the daily grind &#8211; can afford. So we do it differently to the mainstream brand strategy &#8211; it&#8217;s less hands on: we let you tackle the process yourself, and stand on the sidelines, like a coach. Or a vicious monster. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image multiply\" id=\"block-4a3ac9b4-950a-439b-9f79-f0cee727c0df\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/monsta.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CLSme.jpg\" alt=\"Ali dark monsta\" style=\"object-fit:cover\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Helping underdogs find their roar and turn dreams into life.
