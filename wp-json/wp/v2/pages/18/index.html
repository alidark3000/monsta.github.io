OK this is not therapy but sometimes brandstrat can feel like it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monster metaphors aside, Monsta brands are different because they are designed to motivate your customers and your team, not only market your brand. We not only make them with you, we make them out of you (roar).

When I say &#8220;us&#8221; I am mostly referring to the several people living in my skull. (Yes I Know multiple personalities is real no I don&#8217;t have it but it feels like it sometimes.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-fbf046db-d9dc-4ed9-a1d1-4eaf87362f0c\">There is no normal here. Please ask your friends on Linked In if you want normal.

It started with half a decade of web and graphic design. I always thought the process was broken and I didn&#8217;t know why. I quit. Then I discovered The Futur and their Core Discovery framework, which helped me realise that design without strategy (how it ALWAYS happened with small business \/ micropeneur clients) is completely fucked and a waste of money and time. Business people need brand strategists before designers, or designers who can do a bit of brand strategy themselves. BUT WHO WANTS TO PAY FOR THAT SHIT? Not a lot of small businesses, it turns out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-0383117d-1cb3-4b01-bf13-05911283cbb8\">Hence, MoNstA was born to offer these crucial services in ways everyone can afford.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re a brand strategy studio in Brisbane, Australia, helping small to medium sized business get clarity, save money on design and marketing, and get moving at full roar.
